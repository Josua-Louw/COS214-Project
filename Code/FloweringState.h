It inherits from PlantState, part of the plant lifecycle state machine. Care actions, such as watering and fertilizing, are essential to sustain flowering and influence whether the plant returns to a mature state, progresses to senescence, or dies due to insufficient care.
 * @note This stage is pivotal for the plantâ€™s reproductive success and subsequent lifecycle transitions.
